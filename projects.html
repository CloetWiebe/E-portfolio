                This project was commissioned by SportsCube Vlaanderen for the
                module team project. The main objective was to work with the
                Temi robot and its SDK to develop a tour robot. The robot's
                function is to guide customers from the reception area to the
                dressing rooms and then to the locker room.

                The next project was a collaboration with Delaware, a company
                that approached us with a case study involving the "four-eye
                principle," a safety measure used in hospitals to ensure
                accurate medication administration. This principle requires two
                nurses: one to administer the medication to the patient and the
                other to verify the dosage.
              </p>

              <p>
                Delaware tasked us with finding a solution to improve this
                process. In response, we developed a progressive web app that
                utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology and a
                custom-trained AI model. The AI is capable of recognizing
                medication packaging, reading the dosage, and identifying the
                type of medication. The system then cross-references this
                information with an API to ensure accuracy.

                My most recent project took place during my internship at HITLAB
                Howest, where we were tasked with creating an immersive
                experience for the public. The goal was to develop an AR
                application that would allow people to see a completed building
                at a life-size scale, enabling them to visualize how it would
                look once finished.
              </p>

              <p>
                This application was built for the HoloLens and used QR codes as
                anchors to position and orient the building in the real world.
                The most challenging aspect of the project was ensuring that the
                orientation and scale of the building were accurate based on the
                QR codes. This required extensive work with matrices and vector
                calculations to achieve the correct alignment.
