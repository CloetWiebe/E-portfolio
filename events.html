              Friday, March 22, 2024 was a fantastic evening! It was incredible
              to be back at MCT.Starting at 6 p.m. We were warmly welcomed and
              were able to immediately begin the tour of the project room. The
              tours were well organized and a new one started every 10-15
              minutes, so we had enough time to admire the different projects of
              the current generation of students.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the tour, the social part of the evening got underway at
              7pm. The food truck was a great success, and the food tasted
              delicious. There was even a vegetarian option, which was a nice
              surprise for many. It really felt like we were briefly back in our
              college days in Kortrijk, especially as we enjoyed reminiscing
              with former teachers and fellow students. The atmosphere was
              relaxed and nostalgic, just as I had hoped. It also was a great
              opportunity to extend my network.

              MARELEC Food Technologies designs and manufactures high-tech
              portioning, weighing, grading and control systems for the fishing
              and food industry, to optimize the efficiency of the manufacturing
              process. It is a company that is situated in Nieuwpoort, Belgium.
              Really close to where I live. It seemed like a great opportunity
              to connect with the local IT industry in my home town.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was truly eye-opening to witness just how deeply technology is
              integrated into the food industry. I got an up-close look at the
              impressive range of machines they use, from precision portioning
              systems to advanced water-jet cutters for meat, and even their
              in-house developed sorting machines. Each piece of equipment
              demonstrated how innovation drives efficiency in this field. On
              top of that, I secured a summer job there, which will gave me the
              opportunity to further explore the fascinating intersection of IT
              and the food industry.

              This year, I had the privilege of returning to my old high school
              to share my experiences in college and the journey that led me to
              where I am today. It was incredibly rewarding to have the chance
              to inspire the next generation of students. I discussed the
              various paths they can take in college and how to navigate them,
              sharing insights from my own experiences. Additionally, I
              highlighted the projects I've been involved in and explained how
              these have significantly contributed to my personal and
              professional growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make my presentation stand out, I added a creative twist.
              Instead of using traditional tools, I built my slides with
              Reveal.js, a powerful framework that lets you craft stunning
              presentations using HTML. This not only made my presentation
              visually engaging but also gave me the chance to demonstrate some
              of the skills I've acquired along the way.

        <h2>Summer Job MARELEC</h2>

              For the active portion of these events, I will be sharing some of
              my experiences working at MARELEC. As I mentioned in my previous
              presentation, it was truly eye-opening to see just how integral
              technology is to the food industry. During my summer at MARELEC, I
              had the unique opportunity to get hands-on experience with their
              cutting-edge equipment. My tasks varied widely, from software
              testing to operating actual machinery, providing me with valuable
              insight into both the technical and practical aspects of the
              industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, there were also more tedious tasks, such as cataloging
              electronic components. In fact, I counted over 340 different types
              of components and tracked how many of each were on hand. Despite
              the repetitive nature of this work, it gave me a greater
              appreciation for the meticulous attention to detail that goes into
              building these complex systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most rewarding challenges I faced was developing a
              proof of concept using an inductive sensor to detect the full
              extension of a piston. The program I created had to manage
              parameters such as extension and retraction times, as well as the
              duration of the entire cycle. This involved writing code in
              TwinCAT 3 Structured Text for a PLC, which then communicated with
              a Python script. The script handled command-line inputs, displayed
              whether the process succeeded or failed, and logged any
              information about failed cycles. It took me about two weeks to
              complete this challenge. Although Structured Text programming was
              new to me, it was an incredibly valuable learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, my time at MARELEC was fantastic. I learned a tremendous
              amount from the team, and the experience has left a lasting impact
              on my understanding of both technology and the food industry.
